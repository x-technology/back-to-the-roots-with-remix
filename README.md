# Back to the roots with Remix

The modern web would be different without rich client-side applications supported by powerful frameworks: React, Angular, Vue, Lit, and many others. These frameworks rely on client-side JavaScript, which is their core. However, there are other approaches to rendering. One of them (quite old, by the way) is server-side rendering entirely **without JavaScript**.
Let's find out if this is a good idea and how Remix can help us with it?

## Prerequisites

- Good understanding of JavaScript or TypeScript
- It would help to have experience with React, Redux, Node.js and writing FrontEnd and BackEnd applications
- [Preinstall Node.js, npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- We prefer to use `VSCode`, but also cloud IDEs such as [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io) (other IDEs are also ok)

- parrallel data load
- question: load state per component, why should we nest components in data flow?

alex
- [ ] comparison astro, nextjs?
  - how deep should we go? api overview, or deeper. esbuild configs. is remix treeshaking+transformation+build+runtime wrappers+optimizations+vuejs?
- it could validate routes consistency...
- [ ] maybe show the simplest remix implementation?
   - [ ] timebox todo alex
    -- 30 min? --
    express - route - middleware
      @controller -> route -> express.route
    index.js:
      action/route -> backend.js
      component react -> client.js
      esbuild + backend.config -> node backend.js + (server.js)?!
      esbuild + frontend.config -> frontend.js?!
- [ ] another agenda proposal

This workshop will introduce participants to the Remix web framework, a new and innovative full-stack framework that allows developers to focus on building fast, resilient, and user-friendly web applications. The workshop will cover the basics of the framework and will guide participants through the process of building a simple web application from scratch. By the end of the workshop, participants will have a solid understanding of how to use Remix to create web applications that provide a seaml

# esbuild experiment

- see assets
- todos:
  - [x] dev routes server
  - [x] add esbuild, jsx
    - rename to jsx, add esbuild step leave only server export.
      dev server build version should work?
    - change dev server to use esbuild path and run build version
  - ~~dev routes client~~
  - [x] react ssr
  - load data from endpoint loaders
  - how remix works
  --- optional ---
  - streams instead of file render to sting
    - hydrate react on client side
    - server side components?
  - move & optimize transform and export to esbuild plugin
    - use esbuild metafile analyze options to get information about outputs
    https://esbuild.github.io/api/#metafile
